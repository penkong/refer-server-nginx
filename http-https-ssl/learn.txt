each request through tcp 
setup tcp session :
become 3 req , with flags: syn , syn and ack , ack 
there are several headers 

fourth add )frame header : actual data sent 
third add )Ethernet header : info about mac addresses
second add )IPV4 header : info related to ip address also responsible of delivery of each packet
               , length, flags , and next header
first add )TCP header : source port , distantion port 443 , window size ...


----

capture data sent by http :
one layer add to headers

http headers: add info of req to headers

--- 

now https : 
http over tls 


it has 2 more header layer

tls : it contain record layer 
it is responsible for encryption of data


========================

encryption :

symmetric encryption:
(key are same)

data + key = encrypted -----> 
encrypted + key = data

symmetric algo : DES(old) , 3DES(old) , AES (modern) 
advanced encryption system - high length key


---

data --> hash func --> hash (fixed length always)
dont need key normally .


hash algos :

md5 (128 bit) --> create : md5 <name of file>

sha sha-1    160bit
    sha-256  256bit
    sha-512  512bit
command : shasum <file name default use sha-1>
          shasum -a 256 <name of file>
          shasum -a 512 <name of file>

hmac can be used with 2 top hash algo
(work with salt)

---

asymmetric keys and encryption :

private , public 
owner always keep it , public send to world

from sender : data + public > encrypted data > owner : decrypt + private.public > draw out data

on receiver : data + encrypted hash come in > 1)hash func hash data , 2)encrypted hash decrypt with 
public key on receiver (already has public key) > 1 will compoare wiht 2

---

RSA (modern asymmetric) :
it is public key crypto system 
key length can be 1024 2048 3072 4096


PKI : public key infrastructure
set of different protocols , algos , certificates 
use for vpn and ... 

what is certificate ??
digital entity.
set of data , public key of owner of certificate is most important part
pki make sure public key of one provider is trusted by other group.
chain of trust.

what are in certificate?
info about owner(company) , 
issuer(who signed it) , 
signature(? encrypted hash encrypted with private key and put it there) , 
public key

-----------------

CA : certification authority server ,
also work with opnessl



using opnessl for RSA key generation
opnessl genrsa --> it generate private key 
but we need to encrypt private key 
opnessl genrsa -aes256 || -des3
but we must put it in file 

Production of private and public key with openssl :

opnessl genrsa -aes256 -out private.pem
pem is extension used for files that include certificate or private key
what about public key ?
it stored in private key
// -outform PEM -pubout : draw out public key
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem



openssl genrsa -aes256 4096
