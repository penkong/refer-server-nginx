UNDERSTANDING THE GTM HIERARCHY :
tags , triggers , and vars

at heart of GTM  is contaienr 
this is what going to contain all of your scripts adn 
system will inject into page , 

each page can have 
analytic base tags , adwords tags , marketing automation tags 
video tracking tags , ecommerce tracking tags ,


manager put simple snippet js code and it will put all tags in html
do this on load time 


container sit in that pages 

it  contain 3 type of entities  :
tags : are code snippets that collect and manipulate data
  most common analytic tags , some of them are built in in GTM
  
triggers : are rules and conditions that will specify to gtm to
  tell to each tag when to fire .

variables : are bits of info that can be stored and access by your 
  tags and triggers 


tags are logics 
triggers are actions 
variables are args for them 



we can have multi contain
but most commonly one container per website and domain
each contain has its own entities
