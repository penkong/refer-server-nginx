nuvei options :

PCI-descoping : Payment Card Industry  
3D-Secure-compliant service
and more 



for descoping PCI : API + SDK

---------

must choose integration method!!!

Factors to consider when choosing a Nuvei Integration Method :

factor 1 : .Your industry segment and business needs , 
single payment ? no , 
recurring payments ? yes , 
repeat customers? don't know

our business is PSD2 or 3DS ??

what is 3DS : an authentication protocol 
by visa 3Domain-Secure authentication is the interaction between 
your card issuing bank and you and ask you to enter a special 
security code to verify you are legitimate owner of banking.

D1 : acquirer domain (the merchant and the bank to which the money is paid)
D2 : the issuer domain (the bank that issued the cardholder’s card)
D3 : interoperability domain (the infrastructure used by the card scheme to enforce 
     3DS protocol, i.e the Internet, the Merchant Plug-in, and Access Control Server - ACS)

merchants should contact their payments service provider.

3DS v1.0 vs 3DS v2.0 : more frictionless authentication and a better 
user experience across devices.


what is psd2 : Payment Service Directive (EU) 2015/2366
to regulate payment services and payment service providers throughout the European Union
What are the biggest changes?
banks opening their payment services to other companies, 
and it called Third Party Payment Services Providers (TPPs)

PSD2 regulates and harmonizes two types of services: 
1: Account Information Services (AIS)
include the collection and storage of information from a customer’s 
different bank accounts in a single place,

2: Payment Initiation Services (PIS)
other providers facilitate the use of online banking to 
make payments online.
to initiate a payment from the consumer’s account to the merchant’s account by creating 
an interface to bridge both accounts, filling in the information 
needed for the bank transfer 
PS2D also allows clients to make payments to a third party from a bank’s 
app using any of the client’s accounts
PSD has SCA(strong customer authentication)

as BBVA’s Venture Solutions Architect

PSD2 now makes it possible for consumers to authorize a third party to add their financial 
information on their behalf and make payments on their behalf
using their bank account.

PSD2 regulations ensure that banks will create mechanisms to enable third party 
providers to work securely, reliably and rapidly with the 
bank’s services and data on behalf and with the consent of their customers.

open bank project 
includes a set of tools and softwares to handle TPP Registry, API Gateway, Consent Management,
Risk Engine, Multi-factor Authentication and SCA and 
Berlin Group specifications.

after psd2 

customer fintech app --- bank 1
                     --- bank 2
                     --- bank 3



factor 2 : size, skill set, extensibility, and availability of development resources.

factor 3 : PCI DSS certification level
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard 
each Nuvei product set (integration type) specifies the required level of your involvement 
in the collection of customer credit card details, as well as 
your PCI reporting responsibilities,

Direct Merchant Notifications 

After the merchant sends a transaction to Nuvei, Nuvei communicates with 
the customer’s bank to transfer the deposit from the customer’s account to 
the merchant’s account. When Nuvei receives a response from the bank, 
Nuvei notifies the merchant of the result of the deposit via DMN.

sometimes merchant must inform user from un successful transaction

Alternative Payment Methods (APMs) and DMN Notifications


result of the transaction in  status and in payment_method, 
which identifies the payment method that the customer selected.

Approved , Declined , Pending



A checksum is a small-sized block of data derived from another block of 
digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced 
during its transmission or storage. By themselves, checksums are often used 
to verify data integrity but are not relied upon to verify data authenticity.

checksum = a value to check ,data integrity, validity of data.




also nuvei send checksum with http request 
to verify use it 
that label is 
advanceResponseChecksum

To authenticate a DMN response checksum:
Concatenate the following parameters in the exact order as follows:
The merchant secret key followed by the parameters received from the DMN callback:
totalAmount, currency, responseTimeStamp (in GMT), PPP_TransactionID, Status, productId.

do sha-256 on top info
